## Project Description
Discover insights into the most popular programming languages and technologies using data from Stack Overflow. Analyze the number of questions by manipulating the data with dplyr and examine how language popularity changes over time.

---
### Instruction:
Discover the trends in the popularity of programming languages by answering the following questions:

What was the percentage of R questions for 2020? Save the result in a data frame, r_2020, containing five columns: year, tag, num_questions, year_total, and percentage.

Identify the five programming language tags with the highest total number of questions asked between 2015 and 2020 (inclusive). Save the tag names as highest_tags. This variable can be a character vector, tibble, or data frame (if the latter, please use the column name tag).

Bonus: try visualizing the data along the way!
